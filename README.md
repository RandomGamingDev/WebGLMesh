# WebGL2Mesh
A simple library for OOP encapsulation and abstraction of some of the different WebGL features needed for meshes.

Note: If you wanna see examples of how to use the library check out https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2Mesh/tree/main/examples and if you want to learn about the more complex features you can search on Google and check out the WebGL documentation since this is basically just an OOP overlay over the WebGL API to make it easier to use and learn which means that u should be able to figure out how to use the library from the WebGL documentation and searches on WebGL.

Currently the major classes are:
`Mesh.VAO`: Object for managing the Vertex Array Object
`Mesh.VBO`: Object for managing the Vertex Buffer Object
`Mesh.EBO`: Object for managing the Element Buffer object

Check the code and the WebGL documentation for the parameters needed.

To use this library you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/WebGL2Mesh/mesh.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library

Also, this library is based on part of the Wireframe game engine, which is another project that I made, and is more specifically a C++ game engine/framework for graphics and audio abstractions for ease of use (it's 0-cost too :D). You can check that out here: https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Wireframe
